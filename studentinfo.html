        <h3> My Blog</h3>
        <p>I had been looking for a good blogsite and this is just the one I needed and it works well and the good thing is that it saves your work automatically. However, I'd give it 3 stars since it has been crashing a lot even after I updated it. Please look into it. Edit: The app still keeps on crashing!!! I cannot even make a list properly!!!</p>
